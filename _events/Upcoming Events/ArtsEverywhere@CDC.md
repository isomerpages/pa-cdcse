<p>Join us for the launch of ArtsEverywhere@CDC on July 27, 2024, at Paya
Lebar Quarter! Hosted by Mayor Fahmi, Mayor Low, Mayor Denise, and Mayor
Desmond, with Guest-of-Honour Mr Edwin Tong, this event signifies our commitment
to bringing arts experiences to every corner of our community.</p>
<p>ArtsEverywhere@CDC brings arts experiences to communities where they live,
work, and play. Every month, the public can anticipate arts performances,
workshops, and activities around Singapore, fostering a greater appreciation
for the arts. This initiative aligns with Our SG Arts Plan (2023 - 2027)
to build A Connected Society, strengthening social connections and national
identity through the arts.</p>
<p>ArtsEverywhere@CDC is organised in collaboration with the National Arts
Council (@nacsingapore), Peopleâ€™s Association, and the five Community Development
Councils, supported by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, with
@catchsingapore as the official arts and culture media partner.</p>
<p>Join us for an exciting Saturday filled with activities! Enjoy a Malay
drumming performance by NADI Singapura, check out a life-sized installation
and participate in craft activities with Didier Ng and Cherie Ng, get grooving
to beatboxing tunes by HandFX, and even have a poem written specially for
you on the spot by Gasoline &amp; Sugar and The Phoenix Quill.</p>
<p>See you at the launch this Saturday!</p>

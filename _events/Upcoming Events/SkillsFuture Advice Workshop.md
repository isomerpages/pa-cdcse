SkillsFuture Advice Workshop
============================
###### SkillsFuture Advice is a community outreach initiative to raise awareness on SkillsFuture initiatives amongst Singaporeans and to encourage everyone to adopt a lifelong learning mindset and upskill themselves. It is a collaboration between SkillsFuture Singapore, Lifelong Learning Institute (LLI), People’s Association (PA) and the Community Development Councils (CDCs).

Each SkillsFuture Advice workshop is about 60 minutes where participants will get to learn:

1.  Sectoral developments and industry trends
2.  In-demand jobs and skills
3.  Profiling assessment to identify your strengths and interests 
4.  SkillsFuture programmes and initiatives for skills upgrading and career planning

<p>Maybank-South East Money Savvy Programme, a programme by South East CDC
and funded by Maybank, aims to equip youths from vulnerable backgrounds
with essential financial literacy skills and emphasise the importance of
saving. Supported by ITE College East and the Institute for Financial Literacy
(backed by MoneySense and Singapore Polytechnic Enterprise), this 12-month
programme addresses community needs in financial empowerment, livelihood,
and employability.</p>
<p>Key objectives of the programme include:</p>

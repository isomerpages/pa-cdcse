# About CDC Vouchers Scheme 2025


As announced in Budget 2025, all Singaporean households will receive an additional $800 in CDC Vouchers to help with daily expenses. The vouchers are distributed in two tranches — $500 in May 2025 and $300 in January 2026.

This is in addition to the $300 CDC Vouchers given on 3 January 2025. Therefore, all Singaporean households will receive a total of $800 CDC Vouchers in 2025.

Starting 13 May 2025, you can visit [go.gov.sg/cdcv](https://go.gov.sg/cdcv) to claim the $500 CDC Vouchers (May). The process for claiming and spending the vouchers remains the same.

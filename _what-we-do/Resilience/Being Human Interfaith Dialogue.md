Being Human Interfaith Dialogue
===


Being Human Interfaith Dialogue Series aims to support the national agenda of building an efficacious inter-religious society and achieving religious pluralism.

It seeks to engage the participants through meaningful conversations on pertinent and contemporary issues relating to Faith and Racial focus.

The programme consists of a breakout session guided by a team of facilitators and panel discussion with speakers who discuss and present on cross-cultural and interfaith matters.

It offers a safe space for participants of diverse backgrounds to share their personal experiences and perspectives based on the core component of the theme that focuses on our common humanity.

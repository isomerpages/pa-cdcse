<p>Since its inauguration in 2009, the FairPrice Walk for Rice+&nbsp;@ South
East has garnered interest over the years. For every 300 metres of walking
or running recorded, FairPrice&nbsp;Foundation&nbsp;will donate 1 bowl
of white rice, 1 bowl of brown rice and 1 bowl of oatmeal.</p>
<p>South East CDC has been fulfilling our ‘social broker’ role by facilitating
connections between corporate companies like Yokogawa and Wellington and
our community partners who are well-versed in the needs of vulnerable families
in the South East District. This has enabled the distribution of rice and
oats to these families.&nbsp;</p>

<p>SIA came onboard as an active corporate partner of SE CDC and sustained
its commitment to regular volunteering at Goodlife! Makan, from half-yearly
engagements to now, bi-weekly engagement sessions with the seniors. They
interact with the seniors, cook up a meal and even visited their homes
to help fix simple appliances.</p>
<h4><strong>Sing Investments &amp; Finance Limited x St. Hilda’s Community Services</strong></h4>
<p>SIF's generous sponsorship and coordination brought together 33 beneficiaries
from St. Hilda’s Community Services for a delightful walk at the picturesque
Gardens by the Bay. This heartwarming initiative not only contributed to
the mileage for the FairPrice Walk for Rice+ @ South East 2023 programme
but also offered a valuable opportunity for meaningful interactions with
seniors. By promoting an active lifestyle, this initiative embodied the
spirit of community engagement and well-being.</p>
<h4><strong>Junior Chamber International (JCI) x St. Hilda’s Community Services &amp; The Hut Limited</strong></h4>
<p>JCI's generous sponsorship of tickets, transportation, and support from
29 of its staff, the dedicated volunteers, enabled a memorable trip to
Ice Magic for 49 beneficiaries from St. Hilda’s Community Services and
The Hut Limited. This tailored initiative not only provided an enjoyable
experience but also nurtured meaningful connections and moments of joy
for all involved.</p>

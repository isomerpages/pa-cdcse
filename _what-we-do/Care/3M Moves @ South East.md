3M Moves @ South East
===
**Background**

![3M Launch 2021](/images/What%20We%20Do/CARE/3M%20launch_edited.jpg)


In its 9th year, 3M Step-Up Challenge @ South East has been rebranded to 3M Moves @ South East and remains as a joint effort between 3M Singapore and South East Community Development Council (CDC). The word ‘Moves’ narrates an act of movement – the ability to adapt to changes and signifies a group of people moving together towards a common goal. 3M Moves @ South East is a 5E* programme to inculcate a giving spirit among individuals and organisations by encouraging them to participate in various ways, from everyday exercise like jogging to trendy virtual workout classes like CrossFit. 

The partnership with 3M started in 2011 and we have raised over $1.2 Million worth of products for more than 422,700 vulnerable residents.

**How does 3M Moves work?**  
For every 20 minutes of exercise clocked by each participant, 3M Singapore will donate one product to the beneficiaries.

  
	
	
	
	
	
*5E stands for using an **E**asy and **E**njoyable activity that **E**ncourages widespread participation within the community which **E**arns sponsorships for the needy. In doing so, SE CDC also **E**nlarges the value of the giving and thus enabling us to **E**nhance the community ownership and spirit.*

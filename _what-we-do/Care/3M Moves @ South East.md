**Background**

In its 9th year, 3M Step-Up Challenge @ South East has been rebranded to 3M Moves @ South East and remains as a joint effort between 3M Singapore and South East Community Development Council (CDC). The word ‘Moves’ narrates an act of movement – the ability to adapt to changes and signifies a group of people moving together towards a common goal. 3M Moves @ South East is a 5E\* programme to inculcate a giving spirit among individuals and organisations by encouraging them to climb stair for a good cause. 

The partnership with 3M started in 2011 and we have raised over $1.2 Million worth of products for more than 422,700 vulnerable residents.

**How does 3M Moves work?**  
For every 20 minutes of exercise clocked by each participant, 3M Singapore will donate one product to the beneficiaries.

In doing so, SE CDC also **E**nlarges the value of the giving and thus enabling us to **E**nhance the community ownership and spirit.*

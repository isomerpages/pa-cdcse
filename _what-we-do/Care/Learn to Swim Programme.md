<h1><strong>Empowering Lives Through Aquatics â€“ Learn-to-Swim Programme</strong></h1>
<p>Since 2023, Singapore Aquatics and South East CDC have been running a
free Learn-to-Swim programme to equip children and youth from vulnerable
backgrounds with essential water survival and swimming competency skills.&nbsp;This
initiative aims to help children and youth between the ages of 6 and 14
complete the initial stages of SwimSafer, a national swimming and water
safety education programme. It also serves as a scouting platform for coaches
to identify promising aquatic athletes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its launch, over 100 children and youth residing in the South East
district have benefitted from this programme.</p>

On 28th Oct 2021, NTUC FairPrice (FairPrice) and South East Community Development Council (South East CDC) launched the 13th edition of its annual FairPrice Walk for Rice+ @ South East to lift the spirit of giving back while encouraging a healthy lifestyle. To mark its 13th year, Walk for Rice+ @ South East ran for 13 weeks, which started from 28th Oct till 20 January 2022. FairPrice and South East CDC also announced the extension of our partnership for another three years.

The long-running initiative aims to motivate more Singaporeans to walk or run while logging in their mileage for a good cause. Since its inauguration in 2009, the Walk for Rice+ @ South East has garnered more interest over the years and has observed an increase in its total mileage from 61,583 kilometres in 2009 to more than tenfold with 683,771 kilometres in 2020. This also represented a 53 per cent increase from the mileage in 2019. 

The same virtual format was adopted in 2021 where participants can log in their mileage on the website.

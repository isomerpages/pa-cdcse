On 3rd Nov 2022, NTUC FairPrice (FairPrice) and South East Community Development Council (South East CDC) launched the 14th edition of its annual FairPrice Walk for Rice+ @ South East. Approximately, 500 participants gathered at the Sports Hub OCBC Square to celebrate the physical return of this initiative since 2019.

The launch flagged off with a symbolic walk and fringe activities such as spin cycling, floor curling and archery were also available. In 2020 and 2021, FairPrice Walk for Rice + @ South East had been held virtually due to the Covid-19 Safe Management Measures.

The long-running initiative aims to motivate more Singaporeans to walk or run while logging in their mileage for a good cause. Since its inauguration in 2009, the Walk for Rice+ @ South East has garnered more interest over the years and has observed an increase in its total mileage from 61,583 kilometres in 2009 to more than tenfold with 600,000 kilometres in 2022.

From now to 31 January 2023, for every 300 metres of walking or running recorded, FairPrice Foundation will donate 1 bowl of white rice, 1 bowl of brown rice and 1 bowl of oatmeal to a vulnerable family residing in South East District. This year, South East CDC and FairPrice targets to distribute S$100,000 worth of rice and oats to 7,000 vulnerable families in the South East District.

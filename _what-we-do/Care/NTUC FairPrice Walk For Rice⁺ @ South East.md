On 3rd Nov 2022, NTUC FairPrice (FairPrice) and South East Community Development Council (South East CDC) launched the 14th edition of its annual FairPrice Walk for Rice+ @ South East. Approximately 500 participants gathered at the Sports Hub OCBC Square to celebrate the physical return of this initiative since 2019. The launch flagged off with a symbolic walk and fringe activities such as spin cycling, floor curling and archery were also available. For the past two years, FairPrice Walk for Rice + @ South East had been held virtually due to the Covid-19 Safe Management Measures.

The long-running initiative aims to motivate more Singaporeans to walk or run while logging in their mileage for a good cause. Since its inauguration in 2009, the Walk for Rice+ @ South East has garnered more interest over the years and has observed an increase in its total mileage from 61,583 kilometres in 2009 to more than tenfold with 683,771 kilometres in 2020. This also represented a 53 per cent increase from the mileage in 2019. 

The same virtual format was adopted in 2021 where participants can log in their mileage on the website.

### The Wormery Movement

Using a wormery is a great way for the community to deal with food waste. It works by using worms to turn food scraps into fertilisers, which can be used in gardens for leisure or farming. This allows our community to support our national goals, promote environmental responsibility and embrace a circular economy lifestyle.

Community and school gardens located in the South East District will receive the following items to start them off on the wormery movement:

* Two worm bins complete with bedding material and 300grams of compost worms in each bin

* Workshops on setting up the bin with mentorship and wormery support from ITE College East

* Educational materials on setting up and maintaining wormeries

Meet Scrappy the worm, our new mascot for food waste management. 
Through Scrappy and The Wormery Movement, we aim to inspire residents to consider sustainable alternatives for managing food waste and to embrace zero-waste practices as part of SE CDCâ€™s Sustainable Living initiative.


Since Oct 2023, we have invovled a total 11,626 participants and 493 volunteers.

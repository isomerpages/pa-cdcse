### The Wormery Movement

Wormery is a viable alternative to food waste treatment and addresses food waste concerns through an organic approach. Worms can consume and convert compostable food waste into nitrogen-heavy natural fertiliser, to be used in gardens for both recreational and agricultural purposes. This provides a platform for our community to contribute their efforts towards our national agenda, empower green citizenry, and adopt a circular economy lifestyle change.

Community and school gardens located in the South East District will be provided with the following items to start them off on the wormery movement:

* Two worm bins complete with bedding material and 300grams of compost worms in each bin

* Workshops on setting up the bin with mentorship and wormery support from ITE College East

* Educational materials on setting up and maintaining wormeries

South East Community Development Council aggregates local needs and resources, build capabilities in partners and connect communities together. We work closely with our District Councillors, the working professionals in the community and CDC’s resource persons, to keep our eyes and ears in the community, to identify emerging gaps and needs.  As such, we had set up three main committees namely "CARE, FUTURE READY AND RESILIENCE" to sharpen our engagements and programmed to make them more effective and targeted towards our focal areas.

<h1><strong>Mayor’s Harmony Futsal Challenge @ South East </strong></h1>
<p>The second annual <strong>Mayor’s Harmony Futsal Challenge @ South East 2024</strong> successfully
concluded on 14 July at SAFRA Tampines, setting the stage for Racial Harmony
Day next weekend. The event drew an impressive participation of over 100
young athletes from 16 teams across two categories: under 16 and under
21. These participants, representing local community organisations and
schools, competed with enthusiasm, showcasing a spirited display of sportsmanship
and unity.</p>
<p>Organised by the <strong>South East Community Development Council (South East CDC)</strong>,
the challenge aims to foster racial harmony and social cohesion among Singapore’s
youth through sports, in partnership with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OnePeople.sg</a> (OPSG),
a leading advocate in championing racial harmony initiatives. Prior to
the event, a Harmony Learning Journey, Harmony Workshop and Futsal Clinics
were conducted, emphasising South East CDC’s efforts in promoting interracial
and interfaith understanding, appreciation and confidence among participants.</p>
<p>By uniting young athletes from across the South East District and beyond,
the event exemplifies South East CDC’s dedication to nurturing a community
that values diversity and mutual respect. Through the workshop, learning
journey, futsal clinics and matches, participants gained a valuable chance
to learn about and appreciate different cultures, promoting a sense of
unity and teamwork. Beyond demonstrating their athletic abilities, the
youth embodied the values of inclusivity and harmony, reflecting the spirit
of the South East District and Singapore as a whole</p>

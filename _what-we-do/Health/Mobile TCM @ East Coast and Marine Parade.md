<p>The Mobile TCM clinic, serving residents from East Coast and Marine Parade
GRC, was launched in 2021 and 2022 to address the healthcare needs of seniors
in less accessible estates. Due to distance and lack of transport options,
these seniors often face challenges in traveling to Community Clubs (CCs)
or medical institutions for minor ailment treatments.</p>
<p>In partnership with Tao One Ltd, divisions in the East Coast and Marine
Parade GRC have set up mobile clinics to offer Traditional Chinese Medicine
(TCM) services directly to seniors in their estates. Don't miss out on
this convenient and personalized healthcare experience! To book an appointment
with the Mobile TCM clinic, simply reach out to these Community Clubs/
Centres (CC).</p>

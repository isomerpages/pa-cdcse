<p>In 2022, The Straits Times reported that the number of suicides in Singapore
had risen by 25.9%, a total of 476 suicides, increased from the 378 suicides
reported in 2021. The report added that the suicide cases spread across
most age groups but were more prevalent amongst the youth and elderly.</p>

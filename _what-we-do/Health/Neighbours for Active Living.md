<p>Pioneered by Changi General Hospital (CGH) and South East Community Development
Council (CDC), the Neighbours for Active Living Programme (Neighbours)
celebrates 11 years of providing trusted care to over 13,000 seniors in
collaboration with 70 community partners and dedicated Friend-A-Senior
@ South East volunteers.</p>
<p>Launched as a pilot initiative in Bedok and Siglap in 2013, the programme
has expanded to cover the entire Eastern region of Singapore. The programme
supports vulnerable seniors with complex health-social needs, ensuring
continued care post-hospital discharge. The programme's proactive approach
aims to reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions and emergency department
visits. Through the Neighbours Friend-A-Senior @ South East programme,
over 900 volunteers have been trained to provide companionship, monitor
health, and assist with essential tasks, fostering long-term relationships
that enrich the lives of both seniors and volunteers.</p>

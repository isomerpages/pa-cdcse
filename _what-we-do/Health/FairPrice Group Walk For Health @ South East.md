<p>Kicked off on 30 August, FairPrice Group Walk for Health @ South East
transforms your walks and runs into direct support for our community. FairPrice
Foundation (FPF) will be donating $1 worth of supermarket vouchers for
every kilometre clocked. Up to 1,000 vulnerable residents in the South
East District will be supported with $100 worth of supermarket vouchers
each.</p>
<p>Through a series of engaging activities such as mass community walk, health
and wellness workshops, healthy grocery trips, and partner-led walks, the
campaign promotes both physical and mental well-being while rallying the
community to support healthier living and social good.</p>
<p>Make every step count, whether it’s for your health or for a meaningful
cause!</p>

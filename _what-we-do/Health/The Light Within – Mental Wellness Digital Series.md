With the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, many youths are experiencing increased anxiety due to disruption to their academic routines and reduced social interactions with their friends. In response to this, South East Community Development Council’s (CDC) Resilience Committee partnered with T:>Works to bring The Light Within to secondary schools and tertiary institutions in the South East District, to raise awareness and reduce stigma on mental health among students.

The Light Within is a mental wellness digital series which comprises a short film titled ‘Sensitive’ and an animation titled ‘Sleepover’. Coupled with the digital productions, a workshop and an educational kit are what the teachers or lecturers will experience and have as resources to enhance the process of interactions with students. The Light Within not only aims to empower teachers and lecturers with capabilities, tools, and resources to facilitate conversations on related themes to the digital productions but also open discussions on mental health issues.

The Light Within was launched on 25 April 2022 by Mayor Fahmi Aliman at ITE College East.

28 students from ITE College East were the first batch to watch a short film, ‘Sensitive’ , followed by a discussion with their lecturer.

In the upcoming months, we will be bringing this programme to more schools in the South East District.

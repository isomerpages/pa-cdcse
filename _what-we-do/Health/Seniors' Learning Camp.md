<p>Seniors experienced an unforgettable 2-Day 1-Night adventure with fellow
participants aged 45 and above. The 15th run of Seniors' Learning Camp
(SLC) offered a diverse array of team-building games, workshops, and exciting
activities that created a vibrant and joyful environment.</p>
<p>Our mission was clear: to redefine perceptions of ageing by showcasing
the wealth of opportunities and activities available for seniors to lead
active and fulfilling lives. Integral to our camp was an emphasis on collaborative
learning and mentorship, with seniors from our esteemed Seniors' Learning
Camp Alumni (SLCA) taking the lead as facilitators, ensuring a rich and
engaging experience for all.</p>
<p>It was truly a transformative experience for those who participated!</p>

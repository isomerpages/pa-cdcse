<p>The Community Outreach Programme for the Elderly (COPE) was initially
launched in 1999 to reach out to needy elderly individuals residing in
one- to three-room HDB flats in the South East district. The programme
aimed to address the challenges posed by an ageing population by empowering
Social Purpose Entities (SPEs) and their volunteers to offer social and
recreational support to these individuals through regular home visits or
centre-based activities.</p>
<p>Over time, the programme has evolved to include initiatives that recognise
and appreciate the volunteers involved, as well as to enhance the competencies
of the elderly, volunteers, and COPE partners to better support community
engagements. The existing fund not only supports centre-based activities
but also complements efforts to further engage and create networking opportunities
among seniors.</p>
<p>The COPE programme is exclusively open to partners within the South East
District and is by invitation-only. For more details, please contact

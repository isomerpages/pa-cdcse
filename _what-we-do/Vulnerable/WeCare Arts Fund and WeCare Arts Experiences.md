<h1><strong>WeCare Arts Experiences @ South East</strong></h1>
<p>As a component of an extended partnership between NAC and the five CDCs,
the WeCare Arts Experiences (WCAE) promotes the participation of individuals
from underprivileged backgrounds in contemporary arts and cultural events
organised by the NAC and cultural institutions.</p>
<p>These experiences provide an opportunity for beneficiaries to connect
through shared arts encounters with their immediate family members, caregivers,
or friends, thereby enhancing social connections.</p>

Organisations (GROs) and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) are eligible to seek WCAE

<h4><strong>Our Aim</strong></h4>
<p>To develop youth leaders who take an active stance on community issues.
We are committed to enabling youths from various backgrounds to bond and
exchange ideas, building competencies, and empowering youths with the knowledge
of community development and a pro-community mindset.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>Initiatives and Events</strong></h4>
<p><strong>SE-YA! Camp</strong>
</p>
<p>SE-YA! successfully launched its inaugural camp in May 2024, attracting
a cohort of youth volunteers. Over a span of three days and two nights,
participants took part in immersive learning experiences with a focus on
designing community projects, joined beach cleaning activities, and fostered
strong bonds through a range of enjoyable activities. Following the camp,
these enthusiastic individuals were formally inducted into the SE-YA! Executive
Committee (EXCO).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Chinese New Year Celebration and Hari Raya Haji with Tembusu Active Ageing Centre</strong>
</p>
<p>SE-YA! has established partnerships with Tembusu Active Ageing Centre,
collaborating on significant occasions such as the Chinese New Year celebration
and Hari Raya Haji event. Through these partnerships, our youths brought
festive cheer to the community while also sharing knowledge of these cultural
celebrations with the seniors, thereby enriching their understanding of
the diverse cultural tapestry within the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Purple Parade 2023</strong>
</p>
<p>SE-YA! also plays a pivotal role in supporting the annual Purple Parade,
where our youths fervently advocate for inclusivity. Through partnerships
with social purpose entities, SE-YA! actively raises awareness about social
inclusivity, contributing to a more inclusive and harmonious society.</p>

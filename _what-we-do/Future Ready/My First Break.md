# MY FIRST BREAK

My First Break (MFB) is an entrepreneurial programme with an overseas component that trains and equips youth, aged 15 to 21, with basic business skills and knowledge while providing opportunities to conduct their own micro businesses.

After a long hiatus forced by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are thrilled to announce that My First Break is back, and it's returning in grand style! This year, we're embarking on a thrilling journey to Vietnam, where we'll dive headfirst into the world of digital transformation and uncover its game-changing impact on business development.

<h1>Build Your Tomorrow @ South East (BYT)</h1>
<p>Build Your Tomorrow @ South East (BYT) has a vision to “empower our youths
to create a better future for themselves.”</p>
<p>This holistic career exposure programme, known as BYT, is designed to
provide students from Secondary Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning
with the necessary knowledge and skills to enhance their employability
while making informed decisions for their career paths. BYT offers a range
of activities, including career skills classes, exploration workshops,
simulation exercises, job attachments and company visits, which schools
can use to complement their gareer guidance efforts. Through collaboration
with schools, corporations, community partners and other stakeholders,
BYT seeks to provide enhanced employability and a sense of &nbsp;community
contribution.</p>
<p>In 2020, BYT replaced its skills development workshops with career skills
classes to align with Singapore schools’ Education &amp; Career Guidance
(ECG) efforts.</p>
<p>In 2023, a grant was introduced to support our partners who wish to customise
their ECG programmes according to their specific requirements and are willing
to engage their own service providers. This allowed schools to tailor their
programmes to meet their students’ needs in line with BYT’s objectives.</p>
<p>The new tranche of the grant ending Dec 2024 is open for application.</p>
<p>We invite corporate partners to join us in empowering students by providing
valuable opportunities such as talks, workshops, and internships. For students
and schools, we welcome your participation in acquiring essential skills
and knowledge directly applicable to the workforce.</p>

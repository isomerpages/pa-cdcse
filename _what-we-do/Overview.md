<p>South East Community Development Council&nbsp;aggregates local needs and
resources, build capabilities in partners and connect communities together.
We work closely with our District Councillors, the working professionals
in the community and CDC’s resource persons, to keep our eyes and ears
in the community, to identify emerging gaps and needs.&nbsp; As such, we
had&nbsp;set up 4 main committees namely "Vulnerable, Seniors, Youth and
Philanthropy &amp; Donation" to&nbsp;sharpen our engagements and programmed
to make them more effective and targeted&nbsp;towards our focal areas.</p>

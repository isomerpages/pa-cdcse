<p>South East Community Development Council&nbsp;aggregates local needs and
resources, build capabilities in partners and connect communities together.
We work closely with our District Councillors, the working professionals
in the community and CDCâ€™s resource persons, to keep our eyes and ears
in the community, to identify emerging gaps and needs.&nbsp; As such, we
had&nbsp;set up FIVE main committees namely "CARE, FUTURE READY, HEALTH,
HARMONY, SUSTAINABILITY" to&nbsp;sharpen our engagements and programmed
to make them more effective and targeted&nbsp;towards our focal areas.

**Dear Residents and Friends,**

The dawn of a new year offers a chance to reflect on time that has passed and the fresh start that we have all been given. As South East CDC scans the horizon for the next 12 months, we remain committed to supporting the community on every front. A major initiative to uplift our community is the South East Edu Care Fund, which will help students from lower middle-income families cope with everyday expenses, big and small. This way, every child will have an opportunity to shine, regardless of their circumstances.

Another focus for South East CDC is the mental wellbeing of our community. Singapore, like much of the world, has faced a challenging period because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, we remained resilient, thanks to our collective grit and resolve. But the pandemic highlighted the importance of mental wellbeing and taking care of our minds as much as we do our bodies. To strengthen our communityâ€™s mental health, we will be launching South East Emotional and Empowerment Development Support (SEEDS) of Wellness, which comprises a series of mental health-related initiatives.

With each passing year, our stewardship of the environment also becomes more critical. On this front, South East CDC is steaming ahead with plans to make our homes more eco-friendly. One project that supports this is The Wormery Movement: A Sustainable Alternative, an effort to foster zero-waste lifestyle in the district. Transforming such initiatives from vision to reality is a collective effort. As we look to 2024, I would like to thank the many community partners, stakeholders, volunteers and residents who help South East CDC achieve mission success every time.

Also central to these efforts are the South East CDC District Councillors (DCs). I am proud to announce that we have reappointed 40 South East CDC DCs, joined with eight new ones for the new council term. Having seen many of them in action, I am certain that their combined contributions will continue to impact the community. We hope that their energy and passion will bring a sense of vitality to all that we doin the community.

The festive period continues in February 2024 with the Lunar New Year, and on behalf of the team, I wish all residents a joyful holiday ahead. Gong xi fa cai and may 2024 be a bright year for us all!

 
Best Wishes,

**Mohd Fahmi Aliman**

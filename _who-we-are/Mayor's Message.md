**Dear Residents and Friends,**

Warm wishes for 2023! The dawn of a new year is a chance to take stock of our lives and focus on the things that really matter. As we do this, I hope that we will each think about the ways we can better our community. 

Doing good does not have to be a solo activity; in fact, your employer might already have a corporate social responsibility programme to engage and benefit the community around them. Joining such initiatives is one way to connect with colleagues while making a difference. That is certainly the case for staff of organisations like Singapore Airlines, Vision Direct Club and Development Bank of Singapore Limited (DBS), that had organised programmes to brighten the lives of our seniors.

Here at the South East CDC, we want to make it easy to give back. Through partnerships with organisations like the FairPrice Foundation, we have shown that doing good can be easily integrated into daily activities like shopping for groceries. For a sense of how this is done, read about our successful FairPrice 
Walk for Rice+ @ South East this year. A big thank you to all of you who have put your best feet forward for the community! The hundreds of thousands of bowls of rice raised through FairPrice Walk for Rice+ @ South East go a long way towards helping vulnerable households cope with the cost of living. Similarly, the community’s embrace of programmes like the St Andrew’s Autism Centre’s hydroponics programme allows people with moderate to severe autism to reap the benefits of work, in spite of their challenging circumstances. This is just one example of efforts that are being undertaken to promote a more inclusive society, where everyone is seen as a valued member, regardless of their abilities.
I hope these stories will inspire you to make your own impact felt in the community. 
Here’s to a prosperous and Happy Year of the Rabbit for all! 

 
Best Wishes,

**Mohd Fahmi Aliman**

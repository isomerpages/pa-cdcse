**Dear Residents and Friends,**

The fourth phase of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) has brought much joy to residents of the South East District. The TEL's expansion has significantly enhanced accessibility for the residents of the South East District, marking a pivotal moment in our community's development. The TEL stations within the South East District include Katong Park, Marine Parade and Siglap.

Plans for the line were already being laid out in 2001, serving as a testament to our forwardlooking urban planning strategy and the numerous challenges of constructing an underground MRT line in a densely populated area. Despite these challenges, we have succeeded, and with the TEL, residents now enjoy improved connectivity.

The line's opening also plays a part in making the South East District a greener place to live. I am heartened to know that many residents have also become environmental champions in their own communities. The South East CDC is committed to supporting community-led initiatives, which contribute to the Singapore Green Plan 2030 through our *Sustainable Living @ South East Grant*, which will scale up suitable green community projects. One such example is the Siglap Corri-Culture initiative, which empowers residents in Siglap to cultivate edibles at home and in communal spaces.

The Paris Olympics this year serves a reminder of the power of sports. In a similar vein, the People’s Association also organised the Community Championship, a tournament that serves as a national movement to bring people together through community sports.

The unifying nature of sports was also on full display at our *Harmony Futsal Challenge*. The youth players may have come from different backgrounds, but it was inspiring to see how their shared love for sports bridged many of their differences. With the rollout of Healthier SG, we can look forward to enrolling in community sports and wellness programmes to support our customised health plans. As a soccer enthusiast myself, I am very happy to note that sports will be an even bigger part of our lives.

These initiatives promise to cultivate an even more inclusive and united community in our beloved district. They continue a journey started by the South East CDC since our inception, by fostering and showcasing a sense of belonging and familial bonds that many of us feel for our fellow neighbours. This year’s National Day Parade song, ‘Not Alone’, encapsulates this message perfectly — it is a poignant listen as we celebrate our 59th year of independence. Happy National Day to all!

 
Best Wishes,

**Mohd Fahmi Aliman**

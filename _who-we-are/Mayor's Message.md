<p>It is a true honour to be writing to you for the first time as the Mayor
of South East District.</p>
<p>Prior to joining politics, I served in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)
for over two decades, helped Singapore tackle COVID-19 during my stint
at the Ministry of Health (MOH), and led the Agency for Integrated Care
(AIC) as CEO. Beyond my official roles, I also served residents as a volunteer
in various agencies and sectors.</p>
<p>As your Mayor, my focus will be on supporting our seniors and their caregivers,
our youth and young families, and the vulnerable. I hope to assist with
the cost of living concerns that our seniors might face. The recent disbursement
of SG60 Vouchers — $800 per Singapore Citizen senior (aged 60 and above
in 2025) — has proven beneficial in this regard. I also plan to organise
career fairs targeted at youth and young families to promote job security
and long-term employment opportunities.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope to do more for the vulnerable residents among us to live
dignified lives. Together with our Grassroots Advisers and partners, my
team and I will work hard to build a vibrant, inclusive and resilient South
East District.</p>
<p>There is tremendous energy, passion and talent in the South East, which
we should harness to create a vibrant and harmonious community for all.
I look forward to meeting you in time to come. Let us work together in
building a better, brighter and more inclusive South East District!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

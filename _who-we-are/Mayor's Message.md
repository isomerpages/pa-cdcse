**Dear Residents and Friends,**

The year-end period is one for reflection, and as I look back at the past year, I am deeply encouraged by the community spirit that continues to define the South East District. Our collective strength and care for one another embody the *gotong royong* spirit that keeps us moving forward, even in challenging times. As a social broker, South East CDC plays a key role in connecting partners and resources to uplift our community. In recent months, we have seen how important these values of care and community are.

This spirit drives national initiatives like the *SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support Scheme*, which offers a lifeline to those facing employment challenges. South East CDC, too, stands ready to ensure that every resident feels supported and prepared for the future. Thousands of residents — including those seeking new career paths — explored opportunities through our *Skills &amp; Learning Festival @ South East*, especially in growth sectors.

The success of such programmes depends on the many partners, grassroots leaders and volunteers who generously offer their time and energy. I want to take this opportunity to recognise and thank our National Day Awards 2024 recipients for their outstanding service to the South East community and beyond. Their dedication has been vital in bringing our programmes to life, making sure that support reaches those who need it most. Thanks to their hard work, we are able to stay connected to the heart of our community.

Looking ahead, South East CDC is committed to engaging even more stakeholders to build an active and vibrant district. Our goal is to foster a deep sense of belonging among all residents, creating a space where everyone can thrive, feel connected and contribute to the growth of our community. Together, we can continue to uplift one another and make the South East District a beacon of resilience, unity and progress.

With that, I wish all of you a happy and healthy 2025!

 
Best Wishes,

**Mohd Fahmi Aliman**

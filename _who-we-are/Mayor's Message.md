<p>As Mayor of South East District, I am even more focused on walking the ground, specifically to connect, listen and act where I can. It’s in these everyday encounters — whether chatting with seniors, caregivers or youths — that I’m reminded how small acts of care and attention can go a long way. Each of us has a role to play in shaping a kinder, more caring and united community.</p>
<p>This is exactly why my CDC team and I continue to strengthen schemes that address daily concerns, such as the CDC Vouchers Scheme that helps residents stretch their dollar while boosting heartland businesses, and why I’m passionate about crafting initiatives that are tailored to our community’s unique needs.</p>
<p>I’m also delighted to welcome our residents from Aljunied GRC and Hougang SMC to the South East District. There’s something special about bringing people together and discovering the values and interests we share.</p>
<p>As we approach the year-end season, my team and I are developing more community-driven initiatives that matter to you — whether it's supporting caregivers and families, creating opportunities for our young people, or ensuring our seniors can age gracefully with the respect they deserve.</p>
<p>Every resident in our district has a unique personal journey and every small action we take together makes a difference. I believe that by continuing to listen, collaborate and act with purpose, we can make South East a district that truly connects and cares.</p>
<p></p>

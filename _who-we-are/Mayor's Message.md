**Dear Residents and Friends,**

2025 has begun with more support for residents, households and small businesses. Through the CDC Vouchers Scheme, we aim to ease daily expenses for residents while bolstering the businesses that make our community vibrant.

Beyond financial assistance, South East CDC remains committed to fostering a strong, resilient and connected community. In 2024, under our Health pillar<sup>1</sup>, we presented *12 Going on 13: A Story of Facing Change and Finding Hope*, a live musical performance as part of the *SEEDS of Wellness* programme. This initiative aimed to spark conversations around mental well-being.

Through theatre and community events, we reached out to over 2,300 participants, shining a light on mental health issues. Our musical and skit illustrated how perseverance and community support help overcome adversity, promoting understanding and belonging.

This initiative reflects the South East CDC’s holistic approach to enriching lives. Our partnerships across other pillars have brought numerous benefits to the community, including:

* **Care Pillar:** We focus on providing grants and resources to uplift those in need, while collaborating with corporates to enhance community support and expand our reach. A notable example is Citi’s Global Community Day in 2024, which mobilised 235 volunteers, uplifting the lives of 610 beneficiaries within the South East District.

* **Future-Ready Pillar:** We organised events like the *Skills &amp; Learning Festival* to equip residents with tools and other resources for lifelong learning. In 2024, this event attracted 5,000 participants who accessed career assistance and upskilling opportunities, and gained insights into personal growth.

* **Harmony Pillar:** We strive to celebrate diversity and strengthen community bonds through events like the *Mayor’s Harmony Futsal Challenge*. In 2024, this annual event united over 100 young athletes from 16 teams through harmony workshops and sports, fostering understanding and respect among participants.

* **Sustainability Pillar:** We want encourage and cultivate green practices to create a sustainable future. Since October 2023, our wormery movement has engaged over 16,700 participants and nearly 700 volunteers in tackling food waste and knowing more about fostering a circular economy.

This year, we also celebrate Singapore’s 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary. As we welcome the recent Budget’s increased support for all Singaporeans, I warmly invite you to join my team and me in shaping our district. Together, we can co-create a more vibrant, caring and harmonious community.

Let us look ahead to a 2025 filled with good health, happiness and harmony.

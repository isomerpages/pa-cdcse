**Dear Residents and Friends,**

“You make a living by what you get. You make a life by what you
give.” This popular saying rings true especially in the South East
District, where countless residents and partners have set aside
time and energy to champion our community. Their dedication and
energy never fail to inspire me.

For many, this spirit of community and volunteerism was
nurtured at a young age, which you can find out more about through
the various articles in this issue. But it also lives on, as students
grow up to become working adults and seniors. Despite their busy
schedules and heavy commitments, many South East residents have answered the call to give back in whatever way they can. Some gladly take on roles in our flagship programmes.
I spoke to some of them during a recent volunteer appreciation event and learnt that they find being close to the ground and supporting beneficiaries an enriching experience.

Others, such as our District Councillors who come from various professions, enjoy seeing issues from a wider lens. They contribute actively to the South East District by working closely with our community partners to fulfil South East CDC’s three main thrusts, in its role as an Aggregator of Needs and Resources; Builder of Capability and Capacity in Partners and Networks; and Connector of Communities. We work closely with our District Councillors, community and corporate partners to keep our eyes and ears close to the ground, to identify emerging gaps and needs.

As such, we set up three committees to sharpen our engagements and programmes, and make them more effective and targeted towards our focal areas. The Care Committee taps on the community’s existing strengths and resources to create accessible and sustainable platforms to encourage the spirit of giving back. The Resilience Committee aims to build resilient communities and individuals by promoting greater awareness of mental health as well as racial and religious harmony, through building bridges and deepening understanding. Finally, the Future Ready Committee seeks to develop a community that is ready for tomorrow’s challenges by supporting skills upgrading, lifelong learning and
active employment. These are not easy goals to achieve but I am confident that under the stewardship of our Committee leads, we will be successful.
Together, we all work as one to attain our vision of an active and vibrant South East District.
 
Best Wishes,

**Mohd Fahmi Aliman**

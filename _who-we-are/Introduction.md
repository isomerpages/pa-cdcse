<h2><strong>Our Background</strong></h2>
<p>The South East Community Development Council (CDC) was set up on 24 November
2001. Spanning the scenic eastern coast of Singapore, the South East District
comprises the Marine Parade Group Representative Constituency (GRC), East
Coast GRC, and&nbsp;Mountbatten SMC; it is home to more than 500,000 residents.
The District includes some of the island’s most vibrant, historical and
beautiful neighbourhoods, such as Geylang Serai, Joo Chiat, Bedok and Marine
Parade.</p>
<h2><strong>Your Social Broker</strong></h2>
<p>At the helm of South East CDC is Mayor Dinesh, who leads the team in fulfilling
the CDC’s mission – an Aggregator of Needs and Resources, Builder of Capability
and Capacity in Partners and Networks and Connector of Communities. With
these tenets in mind, we hope to build a community, with our residents
and stakeholders, where everyone can feel a sense of belonging and pride.</p>
<p>As your social broker, we work closely with our partners to support, facilitate
and empower community-initiated projects. Our doors are always open to
proposals from schools, non-profit organisations, corporate companies and
individuals; we are happy to provide the platform for you to reach out
to the community or assist a family in need. We believe that everyone can
make a difference and we welcome the chance to help you achieve that difference!</p>

<p>Symbolising a man poised for action, our logo embodies our vision of working
together with the people to forge a closer-knit community. We believe that
there is strength in numbers, and a community which works together will
overcome anything in times of difficulty. The world is constantly evolving
and sometimes this brings uncertainty and anxiety. It is our mission to
help build the South East district into a home where everyone feels a sense
of belonging and is always ready to reach out to those who need a little
help along the way.</p>

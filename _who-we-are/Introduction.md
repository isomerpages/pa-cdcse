## **Our Background** 

The South East Community Development Council (CDC) was set up on 24 November 2001. Spanning the scenic eastern coast of Singapore, the South East District comprises the Marine Parade Group Representative Constituency (GRC), East Coast GRC, MacPherson Single Member Constituency (SMC) and Mountbatten SMC; it is home to more than 500,000 residents. The District includes some of the island’s most vibrant, historical and beautiful neighbourhoods, such as Geylang Serai, Joo Chiat, Bedok and Marine Parade. 

## **Your Social Broker** 

At the helm of South East CDC is Mayor Fahmi Aliman, who leads the team in fulfilling the CDC’s mission – an Aggregator of Needs and Resources, Builder of Capability and Capacity in Partners and Networks and Connector of Communities. With these tenets in mind, we hope to build a community, with our residents and stakeholders, where everyone can feel a sense of belonging and pride. 

As your social broker, we work closely with our partners to support, facilitate and empower community-initiated projects. Our doors are always open to proposals from schools, non-profit organisations, corporate companies and individuals; we are happy to provide the platform for you to reach out to the community or assist a family in need. We believe that everyone can make a difference and we welcome the chance to help you achieve that difference!

The world is constantly evolving and sometimes this brings uncertainty and anxiety. It is our mission to help build the South East district into a home where everyone feels a sense of belonging and is always ready to reach out to those who need a little help along the way.

Dear Residents and Friends,

In what seems like the blink of an eye, we’re well into the new year. 2022 promises to be a new normal for the community, as our children and students step up for their COVID-19 vaccination. With rising vaccination rates, we can look forward to slowly returning to the activities we all love, when the Safe Management Measures allow. I hope that parents reading this will consider the vaccine for your children to protect them. To readers who are not vaccinated, I also urge you to safeguard yourselves and your loved ones by stepping up to get jabbed. This simple act will ensure we each play a part in reducing the risk of getting and spreading Covid-19.

 

Indeed, community service need not be a Herculean task that requires us to sacrifice very much. As many residents show, it can be seamlessly integrated into our busy lives. Just take for example, our South East resident, Ms Karin Chua, a professional who has been befriending seniors over the telephone throughout the pandemic, under the auspices of the Community Outreach Programme for the Elderly (COPE). Just a simple phone call, made from the comfort of her home, can have a profound impact on someone who’s having a rough time, especially the elderly.

 

And it’s not just busy professionals who are stepping up to help: young ones are also balancing school and play with care for the community, just like our very own Community Champion Lee Young Kai. I hope that, as ever, these stories inspire you to lead better development and create a difference for our community.

 

The South East CDC stands ready to help you go further in this noble quest. Be it for contacts, resources or tools, we are, and remain, your trusted social broker. On behalf of the entire South East CDC team, I wish all our readers a Happy Lunar New Year. May the Year of the Tiger bring you and your loved ones much prosperity, health and happiness.
